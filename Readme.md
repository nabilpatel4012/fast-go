## Variables

We can declare variable by typing 
```
<"var"> <"name"><"data-type"> 
```
Or we can declare and initialize at the same without specifying the data-type 
```
<"var"> <"name"> = <"value"> 
```
Also there is a short hand method as well which we can use for declaring and initializing a variable short hand by using ":=" only 
```
<"name"> := <"value">
```
